    "Nuri Demirağ": `<span class="popup-year">1886-1957</span>

Turkish entrepreneur, businessman, and politician.

Nuri Demirağ began his career in 1903, first at Ziraat Bank and later in various state institutions. In 1918, he resigned in 1918 to start producing local cigarette paper, marking his first commercial venture. This project was highly profitable, leading him to successfully undertake the Sivas-Samsun railway project in the early Republic years. His success in additional railway contracts earned him the surname 'Demirağ' from Atatürk.

Besides railway construction, Demirağ initiated several major construction projects. He built facilities like Karabük Iron and Steel Works, İzmit Pulp and Paper, Sivas Cement, and Bursa Merinos factories, as well as Eceabat Airport and the Istanbul Market Hall on the banks of the Golden Horn.

In 1931, he designed a bridge project for the Istanbul Strait with foreign experts. Although he submitted this completed project to the government in 1934, it failed to receive the necessary approval. His aviation ventures began in 1936 by establishing the Nu.D Aircraft Factory where the Beşiktaş Maritime Museum currently stands. Here, he produced gliders and had plans to build a larger factory in Divriği for advanced manufacturing in the future.

He also researched the production of parachutes necessary for pilots, discovering that Bursa silk was suitable for this purpose, planning to produce parachutes in Bursa.

In 1937, aiming to establish an aircraft factory in Sivas, he founded a sky school in his hometown of Divriği to meet the educational needs. Successful students could continue their education at the Sky School in Istanbul.`,

    "Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory": `<span class="popup-year">1937</span>

In the 1930s, noting the deficiencies in Turkey's Aviation Industry, Nuri Demirağ began efforts to address these gaps. He visited and studied aircraft factories in Europe, conducted field research, and prepared reports. On January 22, 1937, a protocol was signed with the Turkish Aeronautical Association for the delivery of 12 training aircraft and 65 gliders, officially opening the Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory on February 10, 1937.

The factory in Beşiktaş, started in 1936, was intended as the R&D center for Nu.D Aircraft Factory. In a 1937 interview, Demirağ mentioned that this factory was designed as a center for R&D in aviation and other scientific tests. He planned to prepare aircraft prototypes in Beşiktaş and then establish a mass production factory in Divriği. One reason for choosing Divriği was its central location in Anatolia, which was considered safe and had railway connectivity. The necessary energy for the factory was to be supplied by constructing a dam on the Fırat (Euphrates) River.

In a 1937 interview, Demirağ stated that he would only employ Turkish engineers and technicians due to a shortage of technical staff and the inadequacy of the current team for the projects, which led him to import engineers from abroad in 1938. This need also motivated his efforts to ensure that relevant training was provided at the Sky School and Istanbul Technical University.

The factory's first model, the Nu.D 36, was designed based on a model previously worked on by aircraft engineer Selahattin Alan (referred to as MVV-1 or ALAN-1), who resigned from Eskişehir Aircraft Factory to work at Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory. The Nu.D 36 was a two-seater training aircraft.

In January 1945, Nuri Demirağ left his business to enter politics, leading to the cessation of activities at both Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory and the Sky School.`,

    "Nuri Demirağ Sky School": `<span class="popup-year">1940</span>

In addition to the aircraft factory, Nuri Demirağ placed great emphasis on educational institutions for training technicians and engineers to design the aircraft planned for production, as well as pilots to fly them.

To this end, he first established the Sky Middle School in Divriği, Sivas. Demirağ funded all the needs of the middle school students. For the theater aspects of the school, he consulted with Muhsin Ertuğrul. Successful students from this middle school were provided further education at the Sky School in Yeşilköy, Istanbul.

The Sky School was integrated with other aviation facilities. In 1940 in Yeşilköy, on the site currently used as Atatürk Airport, Demirağ purchased the Elmas Paşa Estate, creating a flight area measuring 1000x1300 meters. In addition to the Sky School, student dormitories, aircraft repair workshops, and hangars were constructed on this site, collectively referred to as the Yeşilköy Sky Stadium.

Before the facility in Yeşilköy was officially opened, an announcement was made in November 1940 via a newspaper ad calling for young people interested in aviation education to apply.

To attract young people's interest to the Sky School, demonstration flights were conducted across various regions of Turkey using the Nu.D 36 aircraft, as well as in Thessaloniki and Athens.

The opening ceremony of the Yeşilköy Campus was held on August 18, 1941. İsmet İnönü's sons, Ömer and Erdal İnönü, participated in the ceremony, during which Mustafa Turhan, Osman Doğan, and Nuri Demirağ's son, Galip Demirağ—students who had completed their training at the Sky School and become pilots—conducted demonstration flights.

To increase motivation among Sky School students, celebrate the graduations of those who completed their training, and introduce aviation to the civilian population, an event named "Nuri Demirağ Air Festival" was organized on October 14, 1942. During this event, students who had become pilots after training at the Sky School performed demonstration flights both around the Sky School and over Istanbul. Citizens attending the event could win passenger flights later in the day through a lottery.

In January 1945, Nuri Demirağ left his business to enter politics, leading to the cessation of activities at both Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory and the Sky School.`,

    "Nu.D 36": `<span class="popup-year">1936</span>

One of the first Turkish aircraft engineers, Selahattin Alan, initially designed the MMV-1 (also known as ALAN-1) aircraft at Eskişehir Aircraft Factory in 1932. This two-seater training aircraft project laid the foundation for the enhanced Nu.D model. Despite its potential, the project lacked institutional support and remained incomplete. Four years later, after beginning collaboration with Nuri Demirağ, Alan revamped his original MMV-1 design into the Nu.D 36, also referred to as ALAN-2.

The completed Nu.D 36 aircraft, despite Selahattin Alan's limited piloting experience, was taken to Eskişehir İnönü by Alan himself to demonstrate it to representatives of the Turkish Aeronautical Association. Unfortunately, during landing, he failed to see a pit on the runway, resulting in a crash that led to his demise. The crash was officially deemed a result of pilot error, and after passing all necessary tests, the aircraft received flight certification on September 25, 1939.

Emrullah Ali Yıldız, a test pilot for the Turkish Aeronautical Association from 1935 to 1947, inspected the Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory after the accident and conducted test and aerobatic flights with the Nu.D 36, subsequently providing a favorable report to the association. Despite his positive feedback and the court's confirmation that the crash was due to pilot error, Turkish Aeronautical Association officials declined to accept delivery of the 24 ordered Nu.D 36s due to alleged technical faults. Vecihi Hürkuş noted in his book that the accident would have been avoided had there been a professional test pilot like Selahattin Alan.

To attract young people to the Sky School, demonstration flights of the Nu.D 36 were organized in various regions of Turkey, including exhibitions in Thessaloniki and Athens.`,

    "Nu.D 38": `<span class="popup-year">1938</span>

The second aircraft project of Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory, the Nu.D 38 was designed in 1938 and completed its first flight in 1944. This aircraft, controlled by two pilots, was designed to accommodate six passengers and could be modified into a bomber. The Nu.D 38 first flew on February 11, 1944, piloted by Basri Alev, a War of Independence veteran. After receiving its flight certification on March 22, 1944, the aircraft conducted flights from Istanbul to Ankara, Thessaloniki, and Athens.`,

    "Nu.D 40": `<span class="popup-year">1940</span>

Following the development of Nu.D 38, Nuri Demirağ initiated a new project for a fighter aircraft at the Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory, designated as the Nu.D 40. In an interview on August 3, 1938, with journalist Abidin Daver, who was also a former president of Galatasaray Sports Club, Demirağ disclosed details about this new fighter model. He emphasized his commitment to creating an original and national Turkish aviation industry rather than just manufacturing under license from European or American companies, which he believed restricted access to the latest designs and technologies.

The initial design process of Nu.D 40 is documented in a letter Demirağ sent to the Aerodynamic Testing Institute (AVA) in Germany on May 20, 1937. In this letter, he requested a quote for conducting wind tunnel tests on an aircraft with a 10-meter wingspan at their facilities in Göttingen. These tests were carried out on the Nu.D 40 model in Göttingen's wind tunnels during 1938-1939. However, the outbreak of World War II and subsequent political chaos interrupted communications between AVA and Nuri Demirağ. Despite a financial disagreement, the German Aviation Ministry permitted the incomplete test data on the Nu.D 40 to be shared with Junkers for their use.

The EF 112 model developed by Junkers in subsequent years showed notable similarities to the Nu.D 40. Ultimately, the Nu.D 40 project was left incomplete due to wartime diplomatic complications and financial difficulties between the parties involved.

Until January 2019, no information about this project was available in Turkey. It was Dr. Emir Öngüner, a research associate at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), who unearthed documents in the DLR archives that brought this project to light after decades.`,

    "Emrullah Ali Yıldız": `<span class="popup-year">1909 Bursa - 1996 İstanbul</span>

Born in Bursa in 1909, Emrullah Ali Yıldız completed his education at the Yeşilköy Aircraft Mechanic School in 1928. A personal glider project he had developed in Bursa caught the attention of Fuat Bulca, then president of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, who invited him to join the organization.

In 1935, Yıldız received pilot and parachutist training in Moscow along with a team including Sabiha Gökçen.

After returning to Turkey, he served as a test pilot at the Turkish Aeronautical Association for many years. He tested various aircraft models, including T.H.K-1, T.H.K-2, T.H.K-3, T.H.K-4, T.H.K-5, T.H.K-7, and T.H.K-10 in Etimesgut Aircraft Factory.

Yıldız also piloted the test flights for the Nu.D 36 aircraft ordered by the Turkish Aeronautical Association from Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory.

Known for breaking numerous flying records, he had accumulated 10,000 hours of powered flight, 2,700 hours in gliders, and made 115 parachute jumps.

One of his notable achievements was setting a record for the longest flight in a single-seater glider, staying airborne for 18 hours and 35 minutes on August 29, 1936, and then in a two-seater glider for 14 hours and 20 minutes on June 12, 1938.

Apart from his flying expertise, Yıldız was also an inventor, having worked on a Crew Escape System during the 1940s, a technology that would later become standard in advanced jets. The system was designed to automatically eject the pilot from the aircraft in an emergency and deploy a parachute. Unfortunately, the process to patent this invention in the United States was interrupted by the death of his business partner.

Yıldız was also a respected flight instructor, training many pilots throughout his career.`,

    "Selahattin Reşit Alan": `<span class="popup-year">1901 Pirlepe, Macedonia - 1938 Eskişehir</span>

A Turkish aircraft engineer and amateur pilot, Selahattin Reşit Alan was one of the first Turkish aircraft engineers. He was sent to France in 1926 by the Ministry of National Defense for engineering education, where he also trained as a pilot.

Upon his return to Turkey, he began working at the Eskişehir Aircraft Factory in 1930. During his tenure at the factory, he developed the MMV-1 (also called as ALAN-1) prototype, a two-seater training aircraft, in 1932. Despite not receiving support from the relevant institution, this project laid the groundwork for his later work on the Nu.D 36 with Nuri Demirağ, which was also referred to as ALAN-2.

Alan attempted to demonstrate one of the completed Nu.D 36 aircraft to representatives of the Turkish Aeronautical Association in Eskişehir İnönü, despite his limited piloting experience. Unfortunately, he did not notice a depression on the runway during landing, leading to a crash that resulted in his death.`,

    "Vecihi Hürkuş": `<span class="popup-year">1896 İstanbul - 1969 İstanbul</span>

Vecihi Hürkuş, born in 1896 in Istanbul, was a trailblazer in Turkish aviation, contributing significantly as both a pilot and an aircraft engineer to the production of domestic aircraft and the advancement of aviation education. He passed away in 1969 in Istanbul.

In 1924, Hürkuş built Turkey's first domestically produced aircraft, the Vecihi K-VI, in the Tayyare Workshop at İzmir Halkapınar. Entirely designed by Hürkuş, the aircraft successfully completed its test flight but encountered bureaucratic obstacles. These challenges led to Hürkuş's resignation from the Air Forces after he was penalized for flying without an official license.

In 1925, after leaving the Air Forces, Hürkuş became one of the founding members of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, playing a key role in drafting the organization's charter and conducting promotional flights nationwide. However, following a change in the organization's management later that year, he left the association, only to rejoin in 1929.

In the same year, Hürkuş served as the chief pilot at the newly inaugurated Kayseri Aircraft Factory, where he underwent training at the Junkers factory in Germany. His work was greatly appreciated by Professor Junkers, who was reluctant to see him leave. Despite this, Hürkuş returned to Turkey after completing his training.

In 1930, he developed the Vecihi XIV, Turkey's first sports and training aircraft, marking a significant achievement in Turkish aviation. The aircraft's maiden flight from Kadıköy to Ankara was successful, yet it faced regulatory hurdles that impeded its certification.`,

    // Projects
    "Vecihi K-VI": `<span class="popup-year">1924</span>

In 1924, the Vecihi K-VI emerged as the first Turkish-built aircraft, manufactured in the Tayyare Workshop in Izmir, Halkapınar. The aircraft's engine was sourced from aircraft left over by the Greek Forces, and the rest was entirely designed and built by Vecihi Hürkuş.

After its assembly was completed in Halkapınar, the aircraft was transferred to Sevdiköy (Gaziemir) Airfield for final assembly and made flight-ready. Hürkuş sought the necessary documentation for a flight permit by forming a technical committee. However, the committee admitted lacking the technical knowledge and experience to evaluate the aircraft technically. The chairman told Hürkuş, "If you trust your plane, jump in, fly, and save us the trouble," prompting Hürkuş to undertake the maiden and only test flight successfully on January 28, 1925.

After the successful first flight, Hürkuş was penalized for unauthorized flying by the Air Forces Chief of Staff Muzaffer Ergüder, who imposed a 15-day imprisonment and seized the aircraft. This incident led Hürkuş to resign from the Turkish Air Forces.`,

    "Vecihi XIV": `<span class="popup-year">1930</span>

In June 1930, Vecihi Hürkuş began working on the first Turkish sports-training aircraft, the Vecihi XIV, during a three-month leave. He rented a workshop on Keresteciler Street in Kadıköy, Istanbul, and started the project with a machinist named Yusuf and two carpenter friends. After an intense three-month effort, the aircraft made its first flight on September 16, 1930, in the Kızıltoprak area of Kadıköy.

Following its successful maiden flight, the second flight took place on September 17th to Yeşilköy. As his leave ended, on September 18, 1930, Hürkuş took off from Yeşilköy and landed at the hippodrome field in Ankara.

After this successful flight to Ankara, Hürkuş applied for a flight permit from the relevant authorities on September 29, 1930. Ten days later, he received the following response: "Although the Vecihi XIV type aircraft has demonstrated its flight capability during test flights and subsequent air travel from Istanbul to Ankara, we do not have the means to assess the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft. Therefore, a scientific examination is not feasible, and consequently, the necessary navigation certificate cannot be issued." 

Following this response, the aircraft was seized, but Hürkuş sought other ways to obtain the necessary documentation. He reached out to his former student, Şefik Çakmak, with the following message: "The Science Department claims it lacks the means to determine the aerodynamic characteristics for the inspection of my airplane. My dear Major, if the Science Department has yet to be satisfied with the means required for scientific examinations, what fault lies with a citizen who has successfully contributed to our national aviation by giving his all? Therefore, I leave it to your conscience to rectify this injustice and save my airplane. 

If indeed the Science Department is incapable of inspecting this airplane, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have this inspection conducted in the service department of a friendly state. For example, entrusting the technical service of the Czechoslovak government, from which our government recently purchased aircraft, to perform this scientific examination would not be unnatural. Czech aviation and technology are highly advanced and are among the closest in Europe. This would truly reveal the actual value of this national work."

Subsequently, permission was granted for the airplane to be certified in Czechoslovakia. Hürkuş transported the aircraft by rail to Prague, where it underwent testing by the International Committee of Aeronautical Navigation (CINA). After successfully completing all test flights, the aircraft was certified as "one of the best sports aircraft in the world."

Following its certification, Hürkuş returned to Turkey, flying a route from Prague through Linz, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia, Edirne, and Istanbul.

Upon his return, he conducted a flying tour for the Turkish Aeronautical Association with Vecihi XIV. Although Hürkuş delivered the required reports to the provincial representatives, his flight compensation was withheld under the pretext that he had not submitted them, and Vecihi XIV was grounded. This incident led Hürkuş to leave the organization.`,

    "Vecihi Civil Aviation School": `<span class="popup-year">1932</span>

Established in 1932 in Fikirtepe, the Vecihi Civil Aviation School was Turkey's first civil flight school. Hürkuş developed several aircraft projects at the school, including Vecihi-XIV, XV, and XVI, with the help of his students.

The school, which trained 12 pilots and performed advertising flights for companies, faced financial difficulties and problems with the recognition of its diplomas, leading to its closure.`,

    "Mehmet Kum": `<span class="popup-year">1922 Manisa - 2011 İstanbul</span>
    
    Turkish aircraft engineer and instructor pilot.

Mehmet Kum was among the first graduates of the Aircraft Engineering department at Istanbul Technical University (then known as the Higher Engineering School). During his engineering studies in 1940, he volunteered as an intern at the nearby Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory. During his internship, Nuri Demirağ noticed him and took a special interest.

Nuri Demirağ facilitated Mehmet Kum's flight training at Gök Okulu (Sky School). He received his training from the school's chief pilot, Basri Alev, who was also a pilot during the War of Independence. Kum then served first as a pilot and later as an instructor pilot at Gök Okulu.

In later years, he married Şukufe, the daughter of Nuri Demirağ. He continued to work at the Nuri Demirağ Aircraft Factory until its operations ceased in 1940. Subsequently, he pursued his engineering career with his own company, Kum Engineering.

Mehmet Kum was the first Turk to receive the Paul Tissandier Diploma from the FAI (International Aviation Federation - Fédération Aéronautique Internationale), awarded to individuals who have served aviation.

Mehmet Kum, who continued flying actively until his later years, passed away in 2011, making him Turkey's oldest pilot at the age of 89.`,

    "TOMTAŞ": `<span class="popup-year">1925</span>

Founded between 1925-1928 as Turkey's first aircraft factory, TOMTAŞ (Aircraft and Turkish Motor Joint Stock Company) commenced operations in August 1925 through a partnership with the German aviation company Junkers.

The factory was headquartered in Ankara with Refik Koraltan at its helm, 51% of its shares owned by the Ministry of National Defense and 49% by Junkers. Under its operation, manufacturing and maintenance factories were planned in Kayseri and Eskişehir, respectively.

The Kayseri Aircraft Factory, established on October 6, 1926, was one of the largest aircraft production facilities globally. Engineers and craftsmen were brought from Germany, and some workers were sent to Germany for training through the Kayseri Machinist Aircraft School.

During its brief existence, TOMTAŞ performed maintenance and manufacturing of various Junkers aircraft models.

However, due to managerial issues, the company faced a crisis and ceased operations in 1928. Junkers transferred all its shares to the Turkish Aeronautical Association, and in May 1930, the assets of TOMTAŞ were reorganized under the Kayseri Aircraft Factory name.

The name TOMTAŞ was revived in a different form in 2022 through a collaboration between TUSAŞ (Turkish Aerospace Industries), ASFAT (Military Factory and Shipyard Management Inc.), and the support of the Ministry of National Defense, re-establishing TOMTAŞ within Erciyes Technopark.`,

Operational from 1930-1942, the factory resumed activities in 1930 after TOMTAŞ was dissolved in 1928.

In 1932, an agreement with the American Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company resulted in the production of 33 Curtiss Hawk and Fledgling models, followed by the cessation of production.

In 1936, an agreement with the German Gothaer Wagonfabrik A.G. led to the production of 46 Gotha 145A aircraft, and in the same year, an agreement with the Polish Panstwowe Zaklady Lotnicze resulted in the production of 24 PZL-24A and PZL-24C aircraft.

In 1940, a deal with British Philips and Powis Aircraft Ltd. led to the production of 24 Miles Magister aircraft. Since 1950, the Kayseri Aircraft Factory has operated as the Kayseri 2nd Air Maintenance Center.`,

    "Etimesgut Aircraft Factory": `<span class="popup-year">1939</span>

Established in 1939-1950, the Etimesgut Aircraft Factory was set up to fulfill the national aircraft production needs.

The Ankara Wind Tunnel, one of Europe's largest air tunnels at the time, was planned as a complementary facility to the factory and has been operated by TÜBİTAK-SAGE since 1998.

In collaboration with the British manufacturer De Havilland, 30 Miles Magister aircraft were produced at the factory for the Turkish Air Forces and Turkish Aeronautical Association. Two of these aircraft were used for spraying lakes and swamps around Istanbul and Ankara to combat malaria, following an agreement with the Ministry of Health.

Various projects were conceptualized and produced at the factory:
THK.1: A 12-passenger military transport glider. A prototype was produced but found to be impractical.
