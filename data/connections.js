After an intense three-month effort, the aircraft made its first flight on September 16, 1930, in the Kızıltoprak area of Kadıköy. Following its successful maiden flight, the second flight took place on September 17th to Yeşilköy. As his leave ended, on September 18, 1930, Hürkuş took off from Yeşilköy and landed at the hippodrome field in Ankara. After this successful flight to Ankara, Hürkuş applied for a flight permit from the relevant authorities on September 29, 1930. Ten days later, he received the following response: "Although the Vecihi XIV type aircraft has demonstrated its flight capability during test flights and subsequent air travel from Istanbul to Ankara, we do not have the means to assess the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft. Therefore, a scientific examination is not feasible, and consequently, the necessary navigation certificate cannot be issued." National Defense Ministry Air Affairs General Inspector Y. Colonel Macid October 14, 1930. Following this response, the aircraft was seized, but Hürkuş sought other ways to obtain the necessary documentation. He reached out to his former student, Şefik Çakmak, with the following message: "The Science Department claims it lacks the means to determine the aerodynamic characteristics for the inspection of my airplane. My dear Major, if the Science Department has yet to be satisfied with the means required for scientific examinations, what fault lies with a citizen who has successfully contributed to our national aviation by giving his all? Therefore, I leave it to your conscience to rectify this injustice and save my airplane. If indeed the Science Department is incapable of inspecting this airplane, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have this inspection conducted in the service department of a friendly state. For example, entrusting the technical service of the Czechoslovak government, from which our government recently purchased aircraft, to perform this scientific examination would not be unnatural. Czech aviation and technology are highly advanced and are among the closest in Europe. This would truly reveal the actual value of this national work." Subsequently, permission was granted for the airplane to be certified in Czechoslovakia. Hürkuş transported the aircraft by rail to Prague, where it underwent testing by the International Committee of Aeronautical Navigation (CINA). After successfully completing all test flights, the aircraft was certified as "one of the best sports aircraft in the world." Following its certification, Hürkuş returned to Turkey, flying a route from Prague through Linz, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia, Edirne, and Istanbul. Upon his return, he conducted a flying tour for the Turkish Aeronautical Association with Vecihi XIV. Although Hürkuş delivered the required reports to the provincial representatives, his flight compensation was withheld under the pretext that he had not submitted them, and Vecihi XIV was grounded. This incident led Hürkuş to leave the organization.`

    <span style="font-family: 'B612', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
    After explaining the incident, I would like to conclude here by introducing Engineer Selahaddin to my esteemed readers, and I sincerely hope that every Turkish youth will be as beneficial to our country and aviation as this character. I met Aviation Engineer Selahaddin Reşit in 1928 in Berlin at the Funkturm location during the international aviation exhibition. Selahaddin was a gentleman in all his demeanor and actions. I call it a beautiful coincidence: While watching the sports aircraft at the Klem pavilion, I heard a young man next to me saying to himself, 'Ah, how beautiful,' and upon looking at his face, I asked, 'Are you Turkish?' and we introduced ourselves. When he heard my name, he could not contain his joy and said, 'I consider this coincidence a happiness for myself.' He then added that he was an aviation engineer, had graduated from an engineering school in France, was currently learning piloting at the French Moran Aviation School, and had come to see the exhibition to benefit from German aviation technology. He also expressed the joy of this acquaintance with the following words: 'I used to follow the airplanes you built and the stages you went through with precision in our newspapers, feeling excited and admiring you. My affection for you had stemmed from this.' Thus, our friendship began with this aviation exhibition. In this way, we spent several days together at the exhibition, thoroughly examining the modern airplanes we saw there. We jointly admired every beautiful piece we saw. Selahaddin was a bright young man who had spiritually embraced the aviation profession. Pointing at every beautiful work he saw, he would say, 'What could possibly prevent us from doing this in our country, professor?' This was the first fruit of his passion: the MMV 1 type airplane that he built. Consequently, with the birth of this new piece of my ideal path, I was a friend who rejoiced more than anyone. As for the technical value of the MMV 1 type Selahaddin airplane: It would not be correct to deliberate on this topic because 37 years have passed, and the trial phases did not proceed normally; after a few trial flights, the airplane was dismantled. However, it is crucial to pay significant attention to this fact for the endeavors of future generations. Particularly, the trial flights of prototype airplanes are a subject of specialization in themselves, and pilots in this duty are expected to have exceptional piloting skills. However, although Selahaddin was a valuable airplane engineer, his piloting value was limited to the 'A' certificate he received from the Moran Aviation School. His flight experience was insufficient. If the principle of the ecce-prototype prevalent in the world's airplane factories had been considered by the administrators at that time, and if the scientific flights of this airplane had been given to highly experienced pilots, this accident would not have occurred, and the airplane would not have been destroyed. But whether there was a pilot in our air units at that time who had the civil courage to conduct such prototype trials is another matter.</span>
